                    We track which pages are visited and navigation patterns to help website owners understand how
                    their content is being consumed. We collect the URL path (without query parameters to prevent
                    accidental tracking of sensitive data) and referrer information.

                    We parse the user agent string to determine browser type, operating system, and device category
                    (mobile, tablet, desktop, laptop). Screen resolution is bucketed into categories (small,
                    medium, large) rather than storing exact dimensions.

                    We determine the visitor's country from their IP address using a GeoIP database. The IP address
                    itself is immediately anonymized by removing the last octet (IPv4) or using only the first 64
                    bits (IPv6) before any processing.

                    We generate an anonymous visitor fingerprint using a cryptographic hash of the anonymized IP
                    address, bucketed screen resolution, browser name, and a daily rotating salt. This allows us to
                    count unique visitors without tracking individuals. The fingerprint changes daily, ensuring
                    long-term anonymity.
